- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @jusgonzalez
 Passionate about Technology: I've always been fascinated by how technology shapes the world around us. From programming and software development to exploring the latest in innovation, I'm constantly looking for new challenges to tackle.

-   Iâ€™m in the third quarter of my Software Engineering career at ULACIT, diving deep into topics like:
Parallel and Distributed Programming
Data Structures and Algorithms
Machine Learning & AI

-  I'm open to contributing to open-source projects and collaborating with like-minded individuals in areas such as:
Java development
Frontend & backend web development
Optimization of algorithms and performance tuning
Innovative projects in AI, machine learning, or automation

- ðŸ“« Feel free to drop me a message if you'd like to collaborate or have any ideas: jus0912@icloud.com
  

  
- âš¡ Fun fact: I love combining my passion for technology with my love for cars . If Iâ€™m not coding, Iâ€™m probably reading about the latest advancements in automotive technology or taking a scenic drive!
